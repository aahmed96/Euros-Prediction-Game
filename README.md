# Euros 2020 Prediction Game

A prediction game developed using the Django Framework that connects to a relational database to keep track of games, user predictions and user tournament picks. 

## Welcome,


It all started with a group of friends, a love of Football Fantasy Leagues, and a shared desire to for sports betting. An idea to reward points for making correct match predictions. But keeping track of everyone's predictions in a group chat soon turned into a nightmare. We were dealing with players who changed their minds more often than they changed their socks, and waiting for the "excel-guru" to share the latest scoreboard was like waiting for the F at Penn Station. 

So, we decided to take matters into our own hands and build an app that could automate the process. At first, we thought a Google Spreadsheet or a basic webpage would do the trick. But come on, a form for every game? We're not living in the Stone Age here! We wanted something more fun and engaging - something that would keep people coming back for more.

Enter our app. We wanted to make it more than just a place to submit your prediction. We wanted to create a community of users who would talk trash, exchange memes, and keep the competition spicy. We wanted to build a game that people would love to play, even when they weren't winning.

And you know what? We damn near did it! Our app has grown from a small project among close friends to a thriving community of players who love nothing more than bragging rights and a chance to show off their sports knowledge. So come join us, and let's see if you have what it takes to be the ultimate champion.
